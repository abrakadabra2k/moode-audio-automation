Audio automation

This how-to demonstrates a way to integrate Amazon Alexa with Moode Audio (https://moodeaudio.org/) (or Volumio) by using node-red as an integration platform.

There were some other options to such integration, for example create a port forward on your router and deploy an alexa skill to use remotely those API calls but this scenario has a security risk, leaving your moode audio exposed to internet.

This is a more secure approach, not having to open any incoming ports from internet.

Assuming you already have moode audio (or Volumio) installed on a Pi with DAC and already enjoying quality music, you have to install node-red in your raspberry pi (https://nodered.org/docs/getting-started/raspberrypi).

Note that node-red default installation is without password, so you have to create one. It's best practice to run node-red as a simple user, not root, preferably with no valid shell.

Then you have to create the following flows:

![flows](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100039669/154813898-5ebf3ce6-1137-4bbc-8c44-d57fa7b39e66.png)

In order to create these flows you need the following in your node-red:

- amazon-echo-hub, running on port 8980 (need to be added to your node-red):
- 3 amazon-echo-device (also need to installed to node-red). Only thing you have to be careful is the name (that's how you will call them from Alexa).
- For each amazon-echo-device you need to add a function and a http request node-red modules

First function is responsible to start / stop moode audio (change 10.0.0.10 with your moode internal IP):
```
res={}
if (msg.on) {
  res.url="http://10.0.0.10/command/?cmd=play"
} else {
  res.url="http://10.0.0.10/command/?cmd=stop"
}
res.payload=""
return res;
```

Next function is for skip to next / previous song:
```
res={}
if (msg.on) {
  res.url="http://10.0.0.10/command/?cmd=next"
} else {
  res.url="http://10.0.0.10/command/?cmd=previous"
}
res.payload=""
return res;
```

And final function is for handling the volume of moode audio:
```
res={}
if (msg.on) {
  res.url="http://10.0.0.10/command/?cmd=vol.sh%20-up%2010"
} else {
  res.url="http://10.0.0.10/command/?cmd=vol.sh%20-dn%2010"
}
res.payload=""
return res;
```

Almost there! Deploy your node-red flows and make sure that node-red has autostart enabled (systemctl enable nodered.service)

The only thing to do in order for node-red to be accessible from Alexa is to add the following iptable rule in order to redirect port 80 to port 8980 (in order to run node-red as a simple user, you have to use high port):
```
-A PREROUTING -s 10.0.0.0/24 -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8980
```
(Remember to change 10.0.0.0/24 with your own network). Note that Alexa identifies those devices as philips royal hue hub.

All set. Now you only have to discover devices from your Alexa and enjoy high quality audio automation :)

Note: Integration with Volumio is quite similar. You only have to change tha functions URI accordingly (https://volumio.github.io/docs/API/REST_API.html)
